This program simulates the real life two player family game known as connect four, 
where the players alternately drop colored disks into a seven-column, six-row vertically suspended grid.
The objective of the game is to connect four same-colored disks in a row, a column, or a diagonal before your opponent can do likewise. 
The program prompts two players to drop a RED or YELLOW disk alternately. 
Whenever a disk is dropped, the program re-displays the board in the console and determines the status of the game(win or draw(play again)).
